# IBMiUnit
An RPGLE unit testing framework 

## Installation

### Clone Git Repository

This is the easiest way to obtain IBMiUnit; everyone has a Git client, right?

Well, this may not *currently* be the easiest way because the source still has a dependency on the [OSSILE](https://github.com/OSSILE/OSSILE) product. This will be removed in a future version of IBMiUnit but for now we assume and require the OSSILE library.

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to place the new `IBMiUnit` folder on the i Series
1. `git clone https://github.com/MarinaSchwenk/IBMiUnit.git`
1. Open QShell in the `IBMiUnit` folder
1. Run the `build` script; there are 6 optional parameters:
  - `-l <obj-lib>` (that's a letter "L") install IBMiUnit to the specified library; default is `IBMIUNIT`
  - `-s <src-lib>` copy source to the given library; default is to leave the source on the IFS and compile from there
  - `-o <obj-owner>` the user profile that will own the new objects; default is `QPGMR`
  - `-f` copy the obj-lib back into the repository as a save file; this is only useful to the repository contributors
  - `-t` compile the test suite over IBMiUnit
  - `-v` verbose output; this may be helpful or necessary when errors are encountered

You can keep up-to-date with IBMiUnit by pulling from the repository and re-building.

### From Save File (part 1)

1. Create a save file on the IBM i, i.e. `CRTSAVF FILE(xxx/IBMIUNIT)`
1. Download `IBMIUNIT.SAVF` from the IBMiUnit repository
1. Choose one of the transfer options, then continue to part 2

#### Transfer Using CPYFRMSTMF

1. Copy the downloaded `IBMIUNIT.SAVF` to the IFS
1. Copy from the IFS to the \*SAVF, i.e. `CPYFRMSTMF FROMSTMF('/path/to/file/IBMIUNIT.SAVF') TOMBR('/QSYS.LIB/xxx.LIB/IBMIUNIT.FILE') MBROPT(*REPLACE) CVTDTA(*NONE) ENDLINFMT(*FIXED) TABEXPN(*NO)`

#### Transfer Using FTP

1. Go to a command window on your PC
1. Go to the location on the PC where `IBMIUNIT.SAVF` is located
1. Enter one of the following: `ftp (ibmi_ip_address)` or `ftp (ibmi_name)`
1. Enter your IBM i username and password for that system when prompted
1. Ensure the transfer mode is binary (there will be no conversion) with `bin`
1. Go to the library on the IBM i where the save file is stored using something like `cd /QSYS.LIB/xxx.LIB`
1. Transfer the save file from the PC to the empty save file on your IBM i with `put IBMiUnit.savf IBMiUnit.savf`
1. When the transfer is complete, exit FTP with `quit`
1. Close the MS-DOS shell with `exit`

### From Save File (part 2)

1. Create the library for the objects, i.e. `CRTLIB yyy`
1. Restore from the \*SAVF, i.e. `RSTLIB SAVLIB(IBMIUNIT) DEV(*SAVF) SAVF(xxx/IBMIUNIT) RSTLIB(yyy) MBROPT(*ALL) ALWOBJDIF(*ALL)`

## Examples

### Program Source

    ctl-opt bndDir( 'IBMIUNIT/IBMIUNIT' );

    /copy IBMiUnit/QRPGLESRC,IBMiUnit_H

    // test initialization/registration

    IBMiUnit_setupSuite( 'TextUtil Tests' );

    IBMiUnit_addTestCase( %pAddr( toUpperCase_fromLower ) : 'toUpperCase_fromLower' );

    IBMiUnit_teardownSuite();
    return;

    // test cases

    dcl-proc toUpperCase_fromLower;

       assertCharEquals( 'MARINA SCHWENK'
                       : toUpperCase( 'marina schwenk' ) // defined in service program
                       );

    end-proc;

### Running

A successful test example:

    > ibmiunit/rununit qtehdr_t
      All 2 tests ran successfully

A test with a failure:

    > ibmiunit/rununit qtehdr_t                                             
      assertion failure in calculateSurcharges_changeOrder: Number of tariff
        items expected:<1> but was:<2>                                      
      Done: 0 errors, 1 failures, 1 successful test(s)
